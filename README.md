Github Pages website for this project: https://oia20.github.io/What-to-learn-/

This project was to solve to problem of wanting to learn about a topic in a specific category
The webpage generates a random article from the category selected
It also utilizes the Youtube Data API to fetch the top 3 videos on the topic.


Technologies used: 
- Youtube Data API to pull the 3 random videos on the topic
- WikiAPI to pull the articles and content
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS
- VScode
- Github Pages


Problems faced:
- The WikiAPI documentation was particularly bad and hard to parse through what I specifically needed
- pushed through learning media queries to make the website fully responsive


What I learned:
- My CSS improved thoughout this project
- How fetching data from API's works
- Improved Vanilla JS skills.
